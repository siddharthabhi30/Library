Positive noise margin
    It means the range of voltage in input should be greater than range of voltage in 
    the output.

    A component may recive more noise but should produce less range of noise. Is the basis
    of digital circuit.

    If a component produces more noise than it received then the noise margin is negative.

    we call this variable gain. 
        It is change in output voltage to change in input voltage.

    devices which obey this feature is called non linear devices.
