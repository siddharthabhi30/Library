    this video is important.

    it gives us the context of how encoding can be done efficiently
    
    for eg an event with probability of 50% only needs one to bit to encode.
        Theoritically thinking in a set of events , a event with 50% probability divides the complete
        set into two parts, we can just tell if we have data of first set(50% of data) of second set.
        The second set may have different events for eg [event_1_50%, event2_25%, event_3_25%]
        In above case we can only know if event2 occured if we batch the data with cardinality of 4.
        By 4 , 2 bits used.  Using 2 bits we can tell if info is from which out of 4 set.

        11 -> this tells us that we are given information about a set of event in which all are divided into four set. Note one event can have more than 25% probability.Its just the actual value which "11" says has 25% of the prob. 11 tells us 4 th set's element when we divide the set in 4 parts is the answer. Receiver of "11" should have this information that which is 4th element when whole experiment outcomes are divide equally four times.

    Variable length encoding should work great when outcome size is not increasing. If it is then an event with 50% prob can become 1% leaving the encoding mechanism to be inefficient.
