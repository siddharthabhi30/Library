synchronised is helpful when we want one two threasd to access a function 
differently not together 


we can use sleep between two start function of thread so that they occur turn by turn


wait is used with sync so that we can tell other thread to wait for many reason ,,,
we ewant other thread to wait for infinite  time till we notify from other thread
