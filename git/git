we cant get data of master on a feature branch if fdeature branch's change is not merged

rebasing in git https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqVqMwLzOjU


git checkout -b <branch-name> # Create a new branch and check it out

git push <remote-name> <branch-name> 


for us remote is origin

git commit -m "M1"

git remote add origin https://github.com/siddharthabhi30/sadwd.git

git push -u origin master

git checkout -b dev1

git checkout master
git checkout dev1

git pull origin master

if one one side merge conflit is resolved then on the other side also while merging ...origins own feature may be deletd because of how dev1 has
merged his code....overall merge merge conflit wont occure if something is already done on a bracnh with own branch

git branch -d branch_naem to delete a branch
