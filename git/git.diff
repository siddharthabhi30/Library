diff shows difference between tips of branches

+++ is a marker to show changes in first file
--- marker to show changes in the second file

//changes that are staged only , not unstaged one
git diff --cached 


//all changes staged and unstaged since last commit 
git diff HEAD


//ignore white space change
git diff -w

//all the logs with sha code
git log --oneline

//view diff from old_sha_commit from latest working directory
git diff sha_code


//index file shows sha code that we can use for git show..to get actual content
//till that commit

git show index_sha_code_of_that_file


//shows all the merge needs to be done from updated main branch
git dif feat..main


git diff feat main file.txt
//changes staged 
git diff --cached commit_sha


//incase of merge conflict new commit will be there
//if feat merges main...later main can just fast forward


git fetch bring remote copy
git pull brings and merges 


if there is not a conflict between two branches
then git will resolve make commits based on time stamp

//we can fetch and make a branch out of it
git checkout --track origin/feat

//view all the remote branches
git ls-remote

//fetch branch from remote to local
git fetch origin feat


files on github are
1.tracked or untracked or ignored


git ignore


**/bin match any directory

*.zip match any file in repo


//remove from git repo
git rm --cached fileName

//remove from repo and file system
git rm fileName


//if we want git ignore onto our local only, not imp for the project
//change the file in below location
.git/info/exclude


*.log
//will ignore log files in root and subfolder
