//to see from which point we should start  rebase
//to squalsh all of the commits into single commit
//give original base of feat created from main
git merge-base ticket main


//will show all the commit, we can specify which commands to pick , which not to pick
//if commit seq is [one,two,three] two three should be squashed not [one,two] otherwise error: cannot 'squash' without a previous commit | error will  happen
//change pick to squash and manually which messages to pick
git rebase -i <init commit sha of main when feat was cut>

//rebase actually creates a copy of commits to change the parent

//shows history of what actually happened
git reflog

//what if main branch is rebased..we need to find 
//common ancestor and use it for pull
git pull --rebase
