certificates are not encoded by private key

some data which is plainly available in the certificate is encoded.

The client then descripts the data using certificates pubkic key 

But how will client verify that ceritfiate is valid.

    Certificate also contains the signing authority.

    Signing authority may have left its signature (encoded "I am friend" by its own private key)

    The system may already have the public key of "I am friend"
