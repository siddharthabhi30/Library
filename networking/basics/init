OSI model

1. physical layer
    wire or wireless
2. data link layer
    specify how to move info using cables
    ip address

3. network layer
    to comm with other servers across a network

4. Transport layer
    sets up a session using TCP so that servers can comm.
    
5. 

6. presentation layer


7. application layer
    http and https, websockets, email protocal, database protocol 

======================================

LDAP

Transport layer
    
    three way handshake for connection

    four way fin-ack

    tcp reset - > one way handshake

port numbers
    we have different ranges of port numbers
    1. well known 
    
        https uses 443 port number i.e application layer

        https uses TCP protocol i.e layer - 4

        TCP in turn uses IP i.e layer - 7 

    2. registered 
    3. ephemeral


IPv4 addressing

    ip full partition = networking portion + host portion

    classless addressing
        subnet mask 
            it tells what portion are network portion and which part are host portion    
    classful addressing

Subnetting networks

IPv6
    it has 
    unicast address 
        1. global unicast address
        2. Link local address
            local addresses
            local is to connect to local devices.
        3. loopback address

    multicast address
        one to many comm
    
    anycast address
        one of ipv6 address
        load balancer
    

NAT
    layer 3 
    translate current IP to ip of router, router does the translation
    

netcat is a thin layer ove tcp
	it can ping a port of a server but it doesn't know what http is. Although webserver can send respond if input text looks like http header

	'<!doctype html><html><body><h1>A webpage served with netcat</h1></body></html>'

	echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 302 Moved\r\nLocation: https://www.eff.org/' | nc -l 2345



while true; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 302 Moved\r\nLocation: https://www.eff.org/" | nc -vl -p 5551; done



DNS

    host www.udacity.com
        the command gives us the information of the dns server, i.e what data is it storing.


subnet mask is used to identify network host address + atcual computer address


ip addr show:
    THis will show what network interfaces my computer has

loopback interface is used 
    it has fixed ip address 
    it is used by programs to connect and talk to other interfaces.

ip route show default
    gives us the default address of the gateway


We have private and public network addresses
    private address :
        10.0.0.0/8
        172.16.0.0/12
        192.168.0.0/16
        these should never be used as a private IP address.

sudo tcpdump -n host 8.8.8.8
    We can monitor network packets going in and out to above server from out machine

tcpdump -n port 53
    logs dns tr

    https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402800122007-How-to-use-ncat-and-tcpdump-to-test-network-connections


tcpdump -i enp35s0 -nn port 49199
    We can tell tcpdump that we want to look at <port no> and  capture all the packets going throught using -i interface.

    change enp... to lo(loopback) ans use nc to connect.
    
traceroute 
    to trace all the network did it take to reach a destination
