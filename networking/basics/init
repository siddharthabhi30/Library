OSI model

1. physical layer
    wire or wireless
2. data link layer
    specify how to move info using cables
    ip address

3. network layer
    to comm with other servers across a network

4. Transport layer
    sets up a session using TCP so that servers can comm.
    
5. 

6. presentation layer


7. application layer
    http and https, websockets, email protocal, database protocol 

======================================

LDAP

Transport layer
    
    three way handshake for connection

    four way fin-ack

    tcp reset - > one way handshake

port numbers
    we have different ranges of port numbers
    1. well known 
    
        https uses 443 port number i.e application layer

        https uses TCP protocol i.e layer - 4

        TCP in turn uses IP i.e layer - 7 

    2. registered 
    3. ephemeral


IPv4 addressing

    ip full partition = networking portion + host portion

    classless addressing
        subnet mask 
            it tells what portion are network portion and which part are host portion    
    classful addressing

Subnetting networks

IPv6
    it has 
    unicast address 
        1. global unicast address
        2. Link local address
            local addresses
            local is to connect to local devices.
        3. loopback address

    multicast address
        one to many comm
    
    anycast address
        one of ipv6 address
        load balancer
    

NAT
    layer 3 
    translate current IP to ip of router, router does the translation
