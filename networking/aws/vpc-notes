VPC is attached to a gateway (one to one mapping)



a subnet is attached to one route table

a route table by default says that a subnet can communicate with all subnets in the vpc


 Unlike Security Groups, NACLs operate at the subnet level and are stateless, 
 whereas Security Groups operate at the instance level and are stateful.


 NACL is attached to a subnet

 instance -> security grp -> subnet -> NACL -> routing table

In Private NACL 
    We can say that it can accept traffic from a subnet

    NACL are stateless
