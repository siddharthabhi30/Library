VPC is attached to a gateway (one to one mapping)



a subnet is attached to one route table

a route table by default says that a subnet can communicate with all subnets in the vpc


 Unlike Security Groups, NACLs operate at the subnet level and are stateless, 
 whereas Security Groups operate at the instance level and are stateful.


 NACL is attached to a subnet

 instance -> security grp -> subnet -> NACL -> routing table

In Private NACL 
    We can say that it can accept traffic from a subnet

    NACL are stateless

Subnet is attached to a route table.

In private subnet

    security group will say 
        allow inbound from public subnet CIDR for ssh or all can ssh into the security group

    nacl will say 
        allow inbound and outbound from public subnet CIDR

    in the route table


        don't allow connection to the internet.

        allow connection from the public subnet or all subnet within the VPC

    actually route table allow connection from all subnets.


In public subnet

    security group will say 
        allow inbound from local mac ip for ssh port 22

    nacl will say 
        allow inbound and outbound from mac ip address

        allow in bound andoutbound with private subnet 

    in the route table
         allow connection to the internet.

        allow connection from the public subnet or all subnet within the VPC

    actually route table allow connection from all subnets.
